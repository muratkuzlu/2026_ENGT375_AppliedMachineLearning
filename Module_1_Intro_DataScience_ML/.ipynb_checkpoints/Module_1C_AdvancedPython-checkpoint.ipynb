The applications for regular expressions are wide-spread, but they are fairly complex, so when contemplating using a regex for a certain task, think about alternatives, and come to regexes as a last resort.\n",

The following group, the part with (From|To|Cc) means that the line has to start with one of the words that are separated by the pipe |. That is called the OR operator, and the regex will match if the line starts with any of the words in the group. The .*? means to un-greedily match any number of characters, except the newline \\n character. The un-greedy part means to match as few repetitions as possible. The . character means any non-newline character, the * means to repeat 0 or more times, and the ? character makes it un-greedy.\n",

So as map iterates through circle_areas, during the first iteration, the first element of circle_areas, 3.56773 is passed along with the first element of range(1,7), 1 to round, making it effectively become round(3.56773, 1). During the second iteration, the second element of circle_areas, 5.57668 along with the second element of range(1,7), 2 is passed to round making it translate to round(5.57668, 2). This happens until the end of the circle_areas list is reached.\n",

That is, what if I pass range(1, 3) or range(1, 9999) as the second iterable in the above function\". And the answer is simple: nothing! Okay, that's not true. \"Nothing\" happens in the sense that the map() function will not raise any exception, it will simply iterate over the elements until it can't find a second argument to the function, at which point it simply stops and returns the result.\n",

Instead, this is what Python does: It takes the first element of circle_areas and the first element of range(1,3) and passes it to round. round evaluates it then saves the result. Then it goes on to the second iteration, second element of circle_areas and second element of range(1,3), round saves it again. Now, in the third iteration (circle_areas has a third element), Python takes the third element of circle_areas and then tries to take the third element of range(1,3) but since range(1,3) does not have a third element, Python simply stops and returns the result, which in this case would simply be [3.6, 5.58].\n",

    "\n",
    "Where func is the function on which each element in the iterable gets cumulatively applied to, and initial is the optional value that gets placed before the elements of the iterable in the calculation, and serves as a default when the iterable is empty. The following should be noted about reduce(): 1. func requires two arguments, the first of which is the first element in iterable (if initial is not supplied) and the second element in iterable. If initial is supplied, then it becomes the first argument to func and the first element in iterable becomes the second element. 2. reduce \"reduces\" (I know, forgive me) iterable into a single value.\n",
